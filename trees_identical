Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

 class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // Base case: if both trees are null, they are identical
        if (p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }
        // If only one tree is null or the values are different, they are not identical
        if (p == null || q == null || p.val != q.val) {
            return false;
        }
        // Recursively check if the left and right subtrees are identical
        return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}
