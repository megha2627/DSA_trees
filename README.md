# 🌳 DSA: Trees

Welcome to the **DSA Trees** repository — a curated collection of tree-based data structure problems and solutions. This repo is built to strengthen your concepts in tree traversal, manipulation, and problem-solving using fundamental and advanced techniques.

## 📌 What's Inside?

This repository includes practical implementations and problem-solving approaches for:

- ✅ Tree Creation and Representation
- 🔁 Traversals:
  - Inorder
  - Preorder
  - Postorder
  - Level-order (BFS)
- 🧠 Problem-based Implementations:
  - Finding Height of Tree
  - Counting Nodes & Leaves
  - Checking for Symmetry or Mirror
  - Printing Views (Left/Right/Top/Bottom)
  - Finding Ancestors / Lowest Common Ancestor
- 🌲 Recursive & Iterative methods
